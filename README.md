# Python Rubik's Cube Solver

## Overview
This Python program is designed to solve a Rubik's Cube. The application uses computer vision techniques to recognize the current state of the Rubik's Cube and then employs an algorithm to generate a sequence of moves that will solve the cube.

## Features
Visual Recognition: Employs openCV to detect the configuration of the Rubik's Cube.

Efficient Solving Algorithm: Utilizes Kociemba to find the shortest solution.

Visual Guide: User can choose to use either contours or visual guides to determine the colors of the cubies of the Rubik's Cube.

User Interface: Simple UI for easy operation and understanding.
